# Carry-Look-Ahead-Adder
The repo contains the project done as a part of the course VLSI Design in Spring-2021. The goal of the project is to build a 4-bit carry look ahead adder whose inputs are given at a rising edge of a clock through D-flip flops and outputs are obtained through D-flip flops at the next rising edge. The main task of the project is to draw the layouts of basic gates using transistors in MAGIC layout tool and use them to build the adder.
